  abstract = {{Evolutionary robotics is a new technique for the automatic creation
	of autonomous robots. Inspired by the Darwinian principle of selective
	reproduction of the fittest, it views robots as autonomous artificial
	organisms that develop their own skills in close interaction with
	the environment and without human intervention. Drawing heavily on
	biology and ethology, it uses the tools of neural networks, genetic
	algorithms, dynamic systems, and biomorphic engineering. The resulting
	robots share with simple biological systems the characteristics of
	robustness, simplicity, small size, flexibility, and modularity.<br
	/> <br /> In evolutionary robotics, an initial population of artificial
	chromosomes, each encoding the control system of a robot, is randomly
	created and put into the environment. Each robot is then free to
	act (move, look around, manipulate) according to its genetically
	specified controller while its performance on various tasks is automatically
	evaluated. The fittest robots then "reproduce" by swapping parts
	of their genetic material with small random mutations. The process
	is repeated until the "birth" of a robot that satisfies the performance
	criteria.<br /> <br /> This book describes the basic concepts and
	methodologies of evolutionary robotics and the results achieved so
	far. An important feature is the clear presentation of a set of empirical
	experiments of increasing complexity. Software with a graphic interface,
	freely available on a Web page, will allow the reader to replicate
	and vary (in simulation and on real robots) most of the experiments.}},
